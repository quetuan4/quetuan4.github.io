    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Wuhan files</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Leaked documents reveal China's mishandling of the early stages of Covid-19</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15; font-style: oblique; text-align: left;">
        <hr>A group of frontline medical workers, likely exhausted, stand huddled together on a video-conference
        call as
        China's most powerful man raises his hand in greeting. It is February 10 in Beijing and President Xi
        Jinping,
        who for weeks has been absent from public view, is addressing hospital staff in the city of Wuhan as they
        battle
        to contain the spread of a still officially unnamed novel coronavirus. <br>
        From a secure room about <i>1,200 kilometers (745 miles)</i> from the epicenter, Xi expressed his
        condolences to
        those who have died in the outbreak. He urged greater public communication, as around the world concerns
        mounted
        about the potential threat posed by the new disease. <br>
        That same day, Chinese authorities reported 2,478 new confirmed cases -- raising the total global number to
        more
        than 40,000, with fewer than 400 cases occurring outside of mainland China. Yet CNN can now reveal how
        official
        documents circulated internally show that this was only part of the picture. <br>
        The symptoms are: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>fever</li>
        <li>dry cough</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
    </ol>
